# Haskell Foundation Stability Working Group

This is the home of the Haskell Foundation's Stability Working Group (SWG).

## Our Charter

The Haskell language serves (at least) two roles:
 * As a production language used by thousands of developers to get their day job done.
 * As a research language, exploring the bleeding edge of statically typed, purely functional programming.
 * 
The breaking changes necessary for (B) impose substantial costs on (A), so there is a real tension between these two goals.   This tension can leave group (A) frustrated as an apparently endless stream of changes; and group (B) frustrated at the brake on progress that (A) imposes.

And yet many of the features developed by (B) are wildly popular with (A).  No one is advocating freezing Haskell, halting all further language development.  Indeed most of the proposals considered by the GHC Steering Committee (over 400 of them in the last three years) come from industry not academia.

This tension cannot be removed entirely.  The goal of the working group is to mitigate its worst consequences, principally by improving communication between the various parties involved so that everyoneâ€™s expectations are aligned.

One alternative would be to move to a policy of 100% stability, especially of the language itself and its APIs; that is, no breaking changes. There are other language ecosystems that do this.   But the Haskell Foundation believes that would be a mistake to seek 100% stability, a mistake that would kill off the ferment of intellectual change, deep research, and innovative (and genuinely useful) features that characterise the Haskell ecosystem.  Haskell is a thought leader, and must continue to grow and change.

So then the question becomes one of how to manage change, and mitigate its costs.  That is what the working group seeks to do.
