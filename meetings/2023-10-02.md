# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- How can we support the [stable api work](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/charting-a-course-toward-a-stable-api-for-ghc/7646)
  - Reach out in solidarity for the effort.
  - Invite to next meeting.
    - Holding the token: Trevis
- Nightly builds from email
  - How widespread is the desire for nightlies?
    - Maintenance resources are finite
    - Best effort currently; cannot promise dependeable nightly builds without more resources
    - One cause of failures: patches land, based on testing on a few platforms.  Nightly build fails because the patch doesn't work on some other platform/configuration.  It's good to have daily knowlege of this happening; not so good to have to guarantee that every nightly build works on every platform/configuation.
    - Maybe we could say
        - Dependable nightlies for some platforms (the ones we use in per-MR tests); e.g. certain Linux distributions Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora; Windows; mac(?)
        - Non-dependable versions on a best-effort basis, but may well be broken.
        - Nightlies version of [platforms](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/platforms)
    - Not wanting to add stress to team!
    -
 - [GHC Steering committee Stability pre-proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wtbAK6cUhiAmM6eHV5TLh8azEdNtsmGwm47ZulgaZds/edit?usp=sharing);
     - Relates to: [GHC proposal #601](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/601).
     - Relates to: [`-Wsevere` proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/571)
     - Re the `-Wsevere` proposal, Chris proposes the following tweak
         - New language extension:`-XWombat` implies `-Werror=severe`
         - Then, later `GHC202x` implies `-XWombat`
         - Why a new language extension?  We could just say `GHC2024` implies `-Werror=severe`.  But generally GHC20x doesn't affect warning settings, so maybe this would be a change in policy?
         - This relates to conversations here:
 -
