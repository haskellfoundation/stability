## Notes
- GHC release without profiling causing issues downstream. As discussed [on hls](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2857) [and stackage-content](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-content/pull/102)
    - Hindsight: should have done 9.0.3
    - Could do 9.0.3 now
    - Release infra is in a much better state now
    - Do not expect this going forward
    - Holding the token for further discussion: Ben

- [Haskell Architecture Proposal](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-architecture-proposal/4706/1)
    - Has identified ecosystem struggles
    - Documentation could help
    - David to reach out to help bring the author in.

- [GHC.X.Hackage](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27)
  - Second draft: David
  - Making progress on this!
  - Ben has offered feedback; David will revise again

- [GHC tick-tock releases](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/34)
    - Table this until August
    - Update the PR thread: Ben

- [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view)
    - Reach out to key community members
    - Holding the token: Trevis

- GHC warning policy document as discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
    - Work In Progress
    - Holding the token: Chris

- Find industry user groups to help smoke test with ghc preleases from [May](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
    - Holding the token: David
    - Tabling this as we expect the industry cost to doing this to decrease.
    - A package popularity reporting would be great
        - Off by default in cabal/stack that reported
            - a hash of project name
            - packages and bounds for packages on hackage
        - We really like this idea but on hold for now, given bandwidth and timing
