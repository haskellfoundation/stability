# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

  - Simon's [Stability state of play
    doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sX_rXHx8Mj3Kae9GalR2BwZ5-xzl7UpnpMBwl4dqsWY/edit)
    update.
    - Prelude could be reinstallable
      - Imagine it was any other package except
        - If no explicit dependency, then [something] sets a default.
        - Cabal private dependencies might be a way to achieve this.
      - May require [private dependencies](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4035); things
    - Investigate head.hackage, what breakages in base or Prelude are needed?  More precisely, which
      of (1)-(5) in the state-of-play doc caused the need for the head.hackage patch?
      - Are there others not listed?
      - Holding the token: Ben
  - Industrial use; tension between long term support and accessibility/usability
