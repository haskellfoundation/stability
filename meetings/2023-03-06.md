# Agenda & Notes

## Action Items From Previous

- [ ] David will talk to Julian about ghcup and nightlies.
  - David has had some discussions
  - Has a draft document, for collaborative consensus building, that he wants to get agreed.
  - Still private conversations for now
  - Ultimately will need other document(s) to communicate the wonderfulness to various broader stakeholder groups.
  - "Keep nightlies indefinitely".  Maybe "indefinitely" means 5 yrs, rather than truly indefinitely.
- [ ] Ben: Carry `base` stability proposal to CLC.
    - Lots of detailed notes in [the previous meeting](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2023-02-20.md) under "Create a CLC issue for a stability field package"
    - Another recent example of this kind of discussion: [#22946](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22946)
    - Ben will work on this today.  Hope for progress before next meeting!
- [x] Ben: Engage with Eric Mertens on use of th-abstraction
- [ ] Trevis: Examine TH users for possibility of th-abstraction
  - No update on this yet

    - We don't have a great tool currently to automate this particular kind of change
