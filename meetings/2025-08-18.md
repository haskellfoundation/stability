SWG 2025-08-18
==============

Meeting URL: https://meet.jit.si/StableHaskellMeetBiWeekly

Previous meeting [notes](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2025-08-04.md)

# Attendees
- jappie
- Jose Calderon
- Teo Camarasu

# Agenda & Notes

- HIE library split
    - Jappie is making progress, lots of work involved

- Cabal exact-print proposal _seems_ to be passing the TWG, so work can start on that soon.
    - TWG is currently in voting period, which ends August 22

- The implementation of DataKinds seems to not be beavhing as an extension should. Code that should be rejected (or at least, once was rejected) by DataKinds is now not being rejected, see [the GHC ticket](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26318#note_632229)
    - Jappie: You would think that there would be test in GHC's test-suite that would catch these sorts of things
    - Issue and issues like it have been around for years (see Ryan's comment on ticket).
    - What would it take to strengthen the DataKinds implementation.

- Review of extension categorization
    - Why is PackageImports deprecated
    - Jappie: How would you two packages having the same module names without package imports
        - Teo: This might be fixable using a Cabal feature ([mixins?](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-package.html#pkg-field-mixins))
    - Things are are surprising to me that they are "experimentatl":
        - DuplicateRecordFields
        - Strict
            - This feels like the extensions is pretty understood
            - Maybe issue is communication regarding what the extension actually accomplishes
        - Arrows, if it's not stable, why not?
        - Functional Dependencies, is it likley to move?
        -

## In progress projects
### Updates

- [hie library split](https://gitlab.haskell.org/jappeace/ghc/-/merge_requests/1)
  - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18329
  - probably need to rebase due to wired in changes by s. hengel.

- [Simon's list of GHC-related stability issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sX_rXHx8Mj3Kae9GalR2BwZ5-xzl7UpnpMBwl4dqsWY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Work on reinstallable base is picking up steam (Earliest ETA is 9.16)
  - Reinstallable template-haskell also being worked on (Needs investigation but _might_ work for 9.14)

- Jappie: catagorizing head.hackage https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xNAn7qE1X7waI7lAIh9lOUKGuEb9HnRwGWNicaywASk/edit?gid=251085624#gid=251085624
    - [x] Figure out which language extension semantics caused these changes.
    - [ ] Draft a haskell.org blog about findings and advanced warnings


## New items

- [Second round of language extension categorizations](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/9-rAGONfQGGthwrLBmY8_w#)
  - Will turn into ghc-proposal after feedback
  - Suggestions/changes greatly appreciated
