# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Template Haskell issue](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24021)
  - Perhpas related to this [reinstallable base](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/h2z2ELauQs2vzhPDeUDr_g#) doc.
  - Saving this for when Ben is present.

- [GHC2024 Proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/613)
    - Particularly welcome `-XExplicitNameSpaces` because the current situation is:
        - `TypeOperators` implies `ExplicitNameSpaces`
        - `TypeOperators` is in GHC2021; but `ExplicitNameSpaces` is not.  Weird!
        - Principle: if X is in GHC202x then all of X's implications should be.
    - General question: would shifting from GHC2021 to GHC2024 break any code?  E.g. `-XLambdaCase` would not.
    - But switching on `MonoLocalBinds` by default definitely will break code.
    - Would like a deprecation cycle with a warning `-Wmono-local-binds`: compiles with `-XNoMonoLocalBinds`, but emits a warning if a locally-bound value is used polymorphically.  (Because then `-XMonoLocalbinds` will errror.)  The warning could give the signature to add.


- Semantics of implications.
    - `-XGADTs` implies `-XMonoLocalBinds`.
    - If you say `-XGADTs -XNoGADTs` what is the effect on `MonoLocalBinds`.
        - Trevis: off
        - Mikolaj: would like this to switch `MonoLocalBinds` off.
        - Jappie: on [this is the correct answer]

    - More realistically, suppose `-XGADTs` and `-XMonoLocalBinds` were in GHC2024, and GHC2024 was the default language edition, and you say `ghc -XNoGADTs`.
        - Trevis: `-XGHC2024` switches on all its implications "explicitly"; `-XNoGADTs` only switches off `-XMonoLocalBinds` "implicitly". And explicit wins.
        - Mikolaj: Now `-XGADTs` is not on, but `-XGHC2024` is, and the latter is enough to keep `-XMonoLocalBinds` on.  Reference counting!

    - Count votes: extension is on iff more `-XWombat` than `-XNoWombat`.
