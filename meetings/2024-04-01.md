# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Abandoned packages](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/abandoned-haskell-packages/9168)
  - We discussed this last time, but the community is clearly concerned/interested here
  - From last time:
	- Botan bindings as an example:
		- Community groups with multiple maintainers
  - Can HF help here?
    - Require some group of maintainership for sponsored projects?
      - Or a transition plan?
    - GHC.X.Hackage: https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27
      - Could allow anyone to submit changes to work with ghc
        - Community could move faster to update
        - What about required api changes that the maintainer doesn't agree with?
          - This effectively splits the package among users with one set of changes vs "official"
          - See Mozilla disallowing changes made to firefox (creating iceweasel.)
        - Complementary with Stackage development process, which manually prompts package authors to update their packages
        - Note that GHC devs already maintain head.hackage, which *already* contains patches for *all of Stackage* (so that we can test GHC against it).
    - Sometimes a fork exists, and is maintained, but people may not be aware of that
        - How is it communicated to users?

- Are there stability related projects to promote at Zurihac?
