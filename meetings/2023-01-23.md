# Agenda & Notes

## New items

  - John Ericson's `base` reform [proposal](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/47)
      - `base` contains lots of stuff; merit in separating these
          - Basic types like Char
          - I/O library stuff...
          - ...some of which is platform specific
          - Parts of GHC internals (if you are going to depend on these, you should do so consciously; see [CLC issue #105](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/105).
      - Danger of revolution: high risk of breaking stuff
      - Try to make incremental progress as a way to de-risk
      - e.g. keep `base` as a wrapper that re-exports a number of smaller, more focused libraries
      - Will incur costs as we design what goes where -- and may change our minds over time.
      - It would help to have a mechanical check that we have not accidentally change the API.
      - Why separate packages rather than just exposed/not-exposed?  Answer: because people really do sometimes want to depend on GHC-specific internals.
      - Thought: Enhance cabal check to allow a pvp check as a way to mechanically enforce stability with this change.
      - SPJ asks: any actions here?
        - Explore funding the cabal enhancement?
        - Chris will post a summary of this converation to the thread.
        - HF technical proposals process is the driving force here.

  - The [response thread](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-medium-term-priorities/5600) to the GHC medium-term priorities
       - Release cadence /= breakage cadence
       - SPJ wonders: what % of the breakage is due to
           * library changes (addressable by head.hackage mechanism)
           * incompatible language changes, not protected by a language pragma.
           * tools lagging the compiler version
          We could really do with more specifics, precision, war stories.
       - David: often you transitively depend on something that is somehow closely coupled to GHC internals.  [SPJ: it's hard to see how to avoid that.]
       - Key goal: being able to write code that works on old and new (preferably without CPP, but even with CPP is bearable).
       - A serious cost of a faster release cadence is maintaining and applying backports.
           - A "release" means a curated branch, which the GHC team is committed to
               - proactively testing on multiple architectures, and testing against multiple libraries across Hackage.
               - bug-fixing, back-porting bug-fixes from HEAD, and re-releasing
           - GHC team simply cannot do a faster cadence of releases (minor releases come out every 2 months anyway)
           - If you want a fast cadence, use nightly builds.
           - If the nightly builds don't do the job for you, let's talk about would make them better for you.
       - Moritz Angermann explains in detail the problems that breaking changes cause for industrial users:
          - https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-medium-term-priorities/5600/19
          - https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-medium-term-priorities/5600/21

  - Small breaking changes: are some breaking changes too small to matter?
      -  With reference to [`stToIo`](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/119#issue-1537134148)

  - David will talk to Julian about ghcup and nightlies.   It should be easy to get a nightly-build GHC onto your machine.

  - [GHC.X.Hackage](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-x-hackage-a-hackage-overlay-to-ease-adoption-of-new-ghc-versions/4600) has a role to play here; if a new release of GHC comes with a Hackage overlay for a signficant fraction (by usage) of Hackage, that would make the painful-upgrade problem way way easier.

## Updates on in-progress work
  - GHC API discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-10-17.md)
    - Previously holding the token: David
    - Moving, but slowly

  - What is the stable API of base
    - Preliminary result of discussions: All of base is a stable API and will use CLC to make changes (that might consist of extracting guts from `base` - no complete conclusion is found, but a crowdsourced effort is premature)

  - [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view), specifically [#4879](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/4879)
    - Previously holding the token: David + Simon

  - Bulletin discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-10-17.md)
    - Previously holding the token: Chris

  - GHC warning policy document as discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
    - Previously holding the token: Chris

  - [Creating and maintaining a set of hlint rules to promote stability](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/pull/14)
    - Previously holding the token: Trevis
    - Opened [issue](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/issues/1440) asking if we can write rules for typeclasses.

## Parked for expected absence of token holder
