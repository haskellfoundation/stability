# Agenda & Notes

## Items to discuss

- https://discourse.haskell.org/t/analyzing-haskell-stability/10059/2
  - Continuing to explore/gather data in more specifics
  - In a couple of weeks: make concrete recommendations vs [Stability Road Map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sX_rXHx8Mj3Kae9GalR2BwZ5-xzl7UpnpMBwl4dqsWY/edit?usp=sharing)
      - eg. data shows that simply categorising is very helpful; hence our work on [#669](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/669)
      - e.g. Prelude and base re-installable. But see [Ben's comments on this](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/h2z2ELauQs2vzhPDeUDr_g#)

- https://discourse.haskell.org/t/xmultilinestrings-merged/10087
  - What is the stability categorization?
  - https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0601-extension-lifecycle-framework.md
  - **Action**. Add a one-sentence amendment fo 601 to say "Any extension introduced b a GHC proposal is presumed Expermiental unless explicitly specified otherwise (in the proposal)"

- What progress (if any) on an actual categorisation?

    - https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/669, itself based on [this discussion and spreadsheet](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/discussions/635)
    - **Action**: some minor edits arising from our conversation + encourage discussion.
