# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [x] [Major version of Aeson blocking community upgrade process](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/issues/6905)
  - Want to encourage a backported fix to help the community

- [x] Question directly asked to group: How does the CLC relate to the GHC deprecation policy? Are they completely unrelated? If they are, what does it mean to be deprecated, precisely, by GHC?
  - In practice GHC has a judgment call, could be more communicative about policy
  - Suggestion: GHC to mark at each deprecation point
  - Suggestion: Be more consistent about deprecation warnings
  - Ask GHC to define deprecated
  - David: Idea to add links to error/warning messages to users guide/documentation


- [x] Compiler extension stability discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2023-03-20.md)
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21475.
    - Some to and fro about this on the [GHC steering committee email list](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/2023-March/003161.html)
    - David: Idea “-WExperimental” warn on all experimental language extensions, on by default
    - Trevis: Industry would be well served by having extensions marked/documented as “on the leading edge/experimental”
    - Trevis: Attempt a first draft of a ghc proposal for warning flag.
    - David: Hopes this is cheap to pay to implement
