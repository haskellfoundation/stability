# Agenda & Notes

- Administrative point, can someone else run the meeting for the 17th of March?
  - JMCT can if needed.

- Paraphrasing a comment made: GHC 9.8 is abandoned, the status says no further releases.
  - Some communication clarity is needed.

- hie file format stability question:
  We have been experiencing pain on every ghc upgrade with hie files. We use stan and weeder which both demand the version of hie files match exactly the ghc version. Is there anyone working on making those files use a stable format?
  - JMCT to bring up with Andreas Klebinger
