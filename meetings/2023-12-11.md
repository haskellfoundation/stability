# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Transition for loopy-superclass-solve](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24253)
  - Is it reasonable to have 9.6.4 with it in Wcompat?
  - What is the policy?
    - https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/wip/general-rules/principles.rst#3ghc-stability-principles
      - Says no warning stability
      - Do we want `-Wcompat`?
        - Suggestion is to removal; Simon will add to GHC proposal https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/625
  - Future releases of 9.6/9.8 should include ability to name; Ben has marked !11421 for backport, which means it'll be in any future point releases of these compilers.
  - Cannot happen again in the future by https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/11421
  - How can prevent the documentation miss?
    - In particular, which flags are in which flag-groups. See https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24255

- Reinstallable base
  - Somehow making Template Haskell more stable is potentially more impactful than reinstallable base
  - See https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20828, https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24021.  Some good discussion here!
  - Relevant package: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-abstraction
    - Might need more advertisement/promotion to use this over `template-haskell` itself.
  - Advertise a potential HF project to design/build a th-abstraction like project.
    - Need to write what that would look like
      - Goals/design issues.

Thoughts from Ryan GL Scott on `th-abstraction`'s design:

> Briefly, my thoughts on th-abstraction is that it attempts to satisfy two
> related (but distinct) concerns:
>
> - It provides a semantic, rather than a syntactic, representation of
>   data type definitions that applies equally to both ordinary data types and
>   data family instances.
> - It provides an API that smoothes over the differences in the
>   template-haskell API across GHC versions.
>
> Because it is trying to do both things simultaneously, I'm not convinced
> that th-abstraction would be an ideal API for reification in general.
> Nevertheless, perhaps there are some lessons that could be learned from it
> going forward.
