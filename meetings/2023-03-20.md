# Agenda & Notes

## Action Items From Previous

- [ ] David: Conversations about GHC nightlies
    - Pending for next meeting

- [x] Ben: Carry `base` stability proposal to CLC.
    - [Proposal brought to CLC](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/146)
    - Possible mechanisms for codifying the internal/external distinction (this should really be a post on  [HF proposal 47](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/47))
        - Just an out-of-band human-readable list
        - Hijack the Stability field of Haddock.  But this is free text, and although machine-readable the machine doesn't read it.
        - Add a new Haddock field for this purpose.
        - Establish the convention that "`Internal`" in the module name means "internal".  A bit more visible.
        - Split base into two packages: `ghc-base` and `base`.  The latter starts as a shim over the former.  But we'd want some kind of warning to say "don't depend on me lightly".
        - Add a new field in `.cabal` files,alongside `exposed-modules`

    - HF tech group is seeking buy-in from GHC devs and [from CLC](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/145).  **Action Ben** to reply on behalf of GHC team.

- [x] Ben: Bring ask of defining "Technology Preview" to GHC team.
    - Some compiler features are "tech previews", but neither this term, nor which features constiute a tech preview, are clearly defined/communicated.
    - This was discussed on the GHC call. Key points about a tech preview:
      - Expectation that work will continue -- unlikely to just disappear
      - Doesn’t implement all features (best to enumerate: TH…)
      - A list of known bugs/shortcomings listed here (wiki page)
      - Isn’t optimized (produces suboptimal code)
      - Behavior may change in the future, although we will try to document such changes
  - How should this be advertised?
      - Simon: Define it on the web site, describe which things are this.
  - Next step:
      - Place this definition on the Wiki,
      - Use this terminology in the release notes to say which features are tech-previews (give a full list of tech-previews, rather than just the diffs)
      - Link to from release notes where appropriate
  - David: does GHC have a process for tracking when things transition?
      - Answer: no.

- [ ] Compiler extension stability etc
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21475.
    - Some to and fro about this on the [GHC steering committee email list](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/2023-March/003161.html)
    - Classifying extensions considered not very useful by the stability working group.
    - Alternatively, have the table, make it part of GHC source code, and add warning flags to let you know if you use an unstable extension.
    - Not clear how much user pressure there is here.


- [ ] Chris: Add to `mtl` migration guide
    - No update
- [ ] Trevis: Examine TH users for possibility of `th-abstraction`
  - No update on this yet

## New items to discuss

- Interior NULs in `FilePath`s ([CLC #144](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/144))
    - Has potential stability issues because of changing file path semantics, although no observably so for most clients.
    - Probably want to backport
    - Should we bump the `base` version number? Major or minor?
    - Basically a question for CLC.
    - Worth mentioning in the proposal/comment that exceptions are already thrown for bogus filenames
- [Cabal 3.10 released](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/just-released-cabal-3-10-1-0/5978)
