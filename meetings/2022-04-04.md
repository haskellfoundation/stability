- Proposed [`Data.List` monomorphisation](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/22)

## Notes

- GHC.X.Hackage update
    - Ben: Met with Andrea Bedini, the maintainer of [`foliage`](https://github.com/andreabedini/foliage) to guide technical direction. "Foliage is a tool to create custom or private Haskell package repositories, in a fully reproducible way."
    - Looks to be a good foundation for the proposed extensions to head.hackage
    - Currently still struggling to find time to engage in discussion
    - Parked until GHC 9.4 is branched
    - Holding the token: **Ben**
- Update on GHC tick-tock releases
    - Similarly, struggling to find time to push forward discussion
    - Parked until GHC 9.4 is branched
    - Holding the token: Ben
- Update on Language/compiler features to help stability
    - Main idea: collect ideas for language suppport that would help to mitigate the cost of change, and
        - refine,
        - categorise,
        - prioritise
    - Then present them to the Haskell community, inviting
        - feedback
        - further ideas
        - actual cycles to help develop them

    - Then turn (some of) them into proper GHC proposals
    - [Notes from Ben and Trevis's discussion](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw)
    - [One refinement already](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/design/deprecation-mechanisms/removed-pragma)

    - For now, Trevis is holding the token.

- Update on API breakage policy
    - TE published [Opaleye's API breakage policy](http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/opaleyes-api-breakage-policy/)
    - TE submitted to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tpo6u8/breakage_and_deprecation_cycle_policies/), [Discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/breakage-and-deprecation-cycle-policies/4281) and asked for example of other policies but not much came back.
    - Main payload for now: opt-in advice for library authors.
    - 3 release policy was also mentioned [here](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/stability-working-group-meeting-21-march-2022/4274/3)
        - <https://gitlab.haskell.org/haskell/prime/-/wikis/libraries/3-release-policy>
- [Type variable binders in datatypes](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/425) and [Discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/feedback-requested-about-breakage-type-variable-binders-in-datatypes/4241)
    - Discussion was great, we want more
        - The more it happens we hope the involvement will increase
- Proposed [`Data.List` monomorphisation](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/22)
    - Want to make sure those who would dislike it are being heard

### Reducing the pain of breakage

 * Making fewer changes (more conservatism)
   * Just don't changes things at all
 * Making changes that break less:
   * Introducing language and compiler changes to make compatibility easier to achieve in the face of interface changes
 * Breaking with more support:
   * Automated migration and refactoring tools
       * `2to3` (Python)
       * `scalafix` <https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/>
       * `cargo fix` <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-fix.html>
       * [rerast](https://github.com/google/rerast)
       * Jetbrains does this in editor for some languages eg <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/refactoring-source-code.html#ecca098>
