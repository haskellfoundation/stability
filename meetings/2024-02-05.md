# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Fortified language editions](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/636)
  - To discuss next time

- Question: How "experimental" is Experimental?  Some hard cases
    - If too much is "experimental" it loses its value.
    - Simple policies are good.  It would be good to say "we don't use experimental features"
    - Type families: the current design really is not fully satisfying.  But they are so widely used that it'll force too many uses to accept experimental-ness.  Put another way, this wide use means that GHC devs should be careful about breaking changes (as in #625).
    - Action working group: contribute to #635.

- Question: how important are the "library stability" proposals?
    - [Reinstallable base](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/h2z2ELauQs2vzhPDeUDr_g#)
    - [A more stable Template Haskell API](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24021)

   If important, then we could (a) more precisely specify the task, (b) figure out how much it would cost, and `(c)` seek resources to get something done.

- Discussed a possible tightly-focused survey, along the lines of [last times's notes](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2024-01-22.md).
    - How to get it to the right people?
        - Scrape Hackage maintainer addresses
        - Write specifically to sponsors
        - Haskell Discourse, ghc-devs

    - Need to refine the list of obstacles.
    - Get help from Taylor F?  Who used to run the [State of Haskell survey](https://taylor.fausak.me/2022/11/18/haskell-survey-results/).
    - Perhaps ask for the direct dependencies that are blockers when upgrading?

## Jappie's proposed survey

Who are you?
+ a student
+ a professional developer
+ a researcher

I use haskell
+ a couple times per day
+ a couple times per month
+ a couple times per year

I use haskell for
+ hobby programming
+ some commercial software
+ both

what stops you from upgrading ghc?

what are your major pain points when upgrading ghc ?

are there any dependencies that caused upgrade issues? if yes please list them
