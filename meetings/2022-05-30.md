## Notes

- [Was simplified subsumption a net win for industry?](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/r-haskell-was-simplified-subsumption-worth-it-for-industry-haskell/4486)
    - Hindsight: provide a better migration path
    - Hindsight: advertise breaking changes more clearly
    - [WIP Proposal](https://github.com/mpickering/ghc-proposals/blob/deep-subsumption/proposals/0000-deep-subsumption.rst)
    - Idea: Find industry user groups to help smoke test with ghc preleases
         - Holding the token on this: David

- Helping move the community away from deprecated langauge extensions (Rank2Types, OverlappingInstances)
    - Trevis is going to work on improving documentation of extensions that are (a) widely used, (b) deprecated (c) easily avoided by doing something better.
    - e.g. `Rank2Types` is marked as "deprecated" in the user guide, but there is no warning if you use it.  Fix: use `RankNTypes`
    - e.g. `OverlappingInstances` and `IncoherentInstances` are similar.  Fix: use per-instance `{-# OVERLAPPING #-}` or `{-# OVERLAPPABLE #-}` pragmas
    - Could we get volunteers to offer finished PRs that make these changes.
   - Chris questions whether it is worth investing cycles in this project.

- `-Werror`.
    - Maybe we should articulate, in GHC's *breakage policy*, that new warnings may be added that warn about code that currently doesn't warn; and hence `-Werror` will force authors to make *some* change to their .cabal file.
    - `-Wcompat`: new warnings are by default added to `-Wcompat`.  You can switch on `-Werror` and `-Wno-error-compat` (or something like that).  We should explain that.
    - GHC migration guide could list new warnings.
    - Tom will add the link to the Core Libraries warning policy
    - Chris will draft a proposal -- essentially, part of a new GHC breakage policy doc.


- GHC breakage policy.   I wonder if we could draft this ourselves? (Rather than hope that GHC HQ does.)
