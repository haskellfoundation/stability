Previous meeting [notes](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2025-01-20.md)

# Attendees

- Trevis
- Ben
- SPJ

# Agenda & Notes

- [GHC release policy doc](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-hq/-/merge_requests/38)

- GHC release documentation (TODOs)
    - [x] Add a column to the GHC status table on https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-Status to include the download link.
    - [x] Release notes could identify major exerimental features (e.g. JavaScript backend): see #25721

    - In that status table, when does (say) 9.2 go from yellow "stable but no releases planned" to red "not recommended"?  Define these terms:
        - "Current major series": the main released compiler
        - "Stable major series:": the previous version of the main released compiler.
        - "Stable:" you can rely in this compiler, and we will actively backport bug-fixes to it.
        - "No further releases planned".  We do not know of any serious reasons for not using this version, but we are no actively porting bug fixes to it.  That said, if there is a serious bug (especially security bug), and one that impacts users, we would consider making a release to fix it.
        - "Not recommended:" because we will not make any further releases even for major bugs.

    - What does "Current stable releases" mean on https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html
        - [x] Idea: kill off that page in favour of GHC Status page https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-Status
        - [ ] Also: kill off https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/working-conventions/releases in favour of the new release-practices https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-hq/-/merge_requests/38
        - [ ] Also: move "Release practices" in https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-Status into the new release-practices https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-hq/-/merge_requests/38

    - When does a compiler drop off the table entirely?  Really just when the table gets too long.

- Some discussion about how to make progress on
        - reinstallable base
        - Template Haskell incompatibilities
