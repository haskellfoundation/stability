# Agenda & Notes

Post Zurihac!

## New items (Or Zurihac items)

- hie library split
  - Jappie begin this work at Zurihac
      - should these files be performant?
          - they build symbol tables for the names within the binary format...
          - why don't they gzip them??
              - Teo: they only added compression support to the compiler quite recently. They tend to use zstd. It's used for the info-table-map now.
      - are there benchmarks for them somewhere?

- maintainership intent standards
  - Brought up again at Zurihac
  - Original discussion: https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/issues/7
  - Ideas:
    - Allow for more granual selection
      - Counterpoint: lose at a glance communication
    - How to communicate this without increasing burnout or negative feelings?
    - Tiers have positives and negatives
    - Another option is to document best practices
    - Could use a point system instead of tiers
      - Or in addition to tiers and/or percentages
  - Things to track:
    - Do you accept PRs?
    - How long (intent) to respond to issue/pr?
    - How long to update for dependency changes?
