# Agenda & Notes

## New items

- long term support branches for GHC
  - 3 branches of ghc "supported"
  - 1 designated, ahead of time, as long term
  - Desire for "big" changes to happen in the release _following_ an "lts"
  - Using name "lts" likely to cause confusion with stackage, probably good to pick a different name
  - Need to track migration paths between releases (as usual) but also between "lts" releases
