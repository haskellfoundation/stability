Previous meeting [notes](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-06-13.md)

## Agenda
- Updates on in-progress work
  - [GHC.X.Hackage](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27)
	- It would appear that there is some agreement that this is useful outside of the HFTT, do we need to do any more?
  - [GHC tick-tock releases](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/34)
	- Have we reached out to those active in discussions?
  - [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view)
  - GHC warning policy document from last time as discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
  - Find industry user groups to help smoke test with ghc preleases from [May](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
- [Change Generic1 to associate to the left](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/75)

## Notes
- [GHC.X.Hackage](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27)
    - Revise proposal to address misconceptions squarely.
    - Identify problem: libraries are not updated for over a year after release -- reason: 40-deep dependency chains mean that there is a multi-month latency *even if every developer responds quickly* (an implausible assumption)
    - Authors are understandably reluctant to make releases before a GHC is actually released.  So that multi-month clock only starts ticking after GHC is actually released.
    - Our goal: make it easy for everyone (developers, users, everyone) to (a) contribute library patches, and (b) access all the patches that others have contributed
    - Problem is not "coming up with the patch"; it's "making the patch easily available"
    - Proposal may address the needs of a silent majority
    - Hackage release process remains sequential.
    - If we had GHC.X.Hackage, then task X would be faster/easier.
    - David C says: People today make progress by pointing their stack/cabal to a hand-rolled set of patches (i.e each is a pointer to a particular commit, maybe not merged yet, in the package's Git repo).  This is massively duplicative... everyone does this separately.  We want to share this work.
    - Give a worked example: an author with many dependencies can use GHC.X.Hackage can fix their package now.
    - It would be great to have a progress tracker that showed what libraries are next in the queue to be updated on Hackage, and send maintainers email to tell them.
    - Second draft: David


- [GHC tick-tock releases](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/34)
    - Holding the token to reach out more: Ben
    - Why not release annually instead?
        - Pressure for last-minute inclusions
        - Difficulty for release managers
        - Correctness issues for huge releases (though somewhat mitigated by head.hackage these days)

- [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view)
    - Holding the token: Trevis

- GHC warning policy document from last time as discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)

- Find industry user groups to help smoke test with ghc preleases from [May](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
    - Holding the token: David

- [Change Generic1 to associate to the left](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/75)
    - GHC.X.Hackage and generalizations can help support doing the breakage analysis
