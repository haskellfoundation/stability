## Notes of meeting

- Creating and maintaining a set of hlint rules to promote stability.
  - Can/should we?
  - Allows us to catch changes earlier
  - Applies to more than `-Wcompat`
  - Does not require changes on libraries in any way.
  - Can be iterated very quickly
  - Not limited to deprecations, can be something like best practices
    - Though we might end up with long bikeshedding discussions
    - We do not want to do this though, keep ours to just breaking changes.
  - Related idea:
      - Bulletin of changes - what has happened and why?
      - Monthly/quarerly/as-needed big changes that are distrubuted.
  - How do we know what packages to include?
      - Add/remove per community feedback, start with judgement calls
      - If we miss then situation is exactly as today
  - open PR with initial rules
      - Holding the token: Trevis
- GHC API
  - Still need to assemble group (see prior minutes)
	- Holding the token: David
  - Idea: Module hierarchy could help, a single `GHC` module is too monolithic to serve as a reasonable interface
  - No progress
- [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view)
  - Next step is to ask for in-kind donation from sponsor who wants to implement "Deprecating exports"
    - Holding the token: David
- GHC warning policy document as discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
  - No progress yet
  - Holding the token: Chris
- [GHC.X.Hackage second draft](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27)
  - Make next hackage and look at adoption.
  - Hazard is in communications.
      - First bulletin could be announcing this?
  - Submit or close proposal
      - Submission for vote we think would be welcomed
      - Holding the token for a comment: David
- Bulletin
  - Keep in SWG repo
  - "Haskell Changelog"
  - Holding the token: Chris
