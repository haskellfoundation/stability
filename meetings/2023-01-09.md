# Agenda & Notes

## New items

- CLC has open call for participation.
- [Safe Haskell](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/deprecating-safe-haskell-or-heavily-investing-in-it/5489)
    - Does anyone in the group see a particular reason to fight for it to continue? (no)
    - The cost: libraries feel obligated to use it, in case a user might want it. This increases the cost, and safety inference is brittle.
    - E.g. new contributors try to "do the right thing", and Safe Haskell annotations are a footgun
    - Should we just announce not to use it, rather than get rid of it?
    - Arguments for removal:
        - It is broken: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21705, https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20078
        - It has poor usability: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19590
        - It interacts badly with `GHC2021`: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19605
        - It can break in non-obvious ways and incurs maintenance overhead: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19002
        - Its claimed promises are broken by GNTD, a ubiquitous and useful extension: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/8827
        - It poses a small maintenance overhead on GHC and tooling developers: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22728, https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19604
    - Perhaps we can begin by socially making it less prominent, e.g. by having Haddock output not prominently present it?

## Updates on in-progress work
  - GHC API discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-10-17.md)
    - Previously holding the token: David
    - Moving, but slowly

  - What is the stable  API of base
    - Schedule Zurihac project?
      - No longer needed
    - Preliminary result of discussions: All of base is a stable API and will use CLC to make changes (that might consist of extracting guts from `base` - no complete conclusion is found, but a crowdsourced effort is premature)

  - [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view), specifically [#4879](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/4879)
    - Previously holding the token: David + Simon
    - Seeking volunteers for #4879 (deprecating exports); none yet; think about HF funding for this
      - Have a lead on a potential volunteer.
    - Are there any other tasks for which modest HF funding would unlock real value?
      - Blocked on this currently.

  - Bulletin discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-10-17.md)
    - Previously holding the token: Chris
    - No progress currently

  - GHC warning policy document as discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
    - Previously holding the token: Chris
    - No progress currently, deprioritized relative to bulletin.


  - [Creating and maintaining a set of hlint rules to promote stability](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/pull/14)
    - Previously holding the token: Trevis
    - Opened [issue](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/issues/1440) asking if we can write rules for typeclasses.

## Parked for expected absence of token holder

## For next week

 - Look over John Ericson's `base` reform proposal: https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/47
