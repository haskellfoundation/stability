# Agenda & Notes

- How can we help GHC distribution channels? https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-metadata/issues/255
  - How can we help find issues earlier?
  - This group/HF could be a bridge to distribution channels/packagers and ghc, reaching out to get closer involvement between the groups.
- Reviving [language features for stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw)
  - Some of these have landed!
