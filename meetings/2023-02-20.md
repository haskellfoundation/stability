# Agenda & Notes

## Action Items From Previous

- [ ] David will talk to Julian about ghcup and nightlies.
  - Need update from David.
- [ ] Trevis: Create a CLC issue for a stability field package
  - Each module in base has a "stability" field, but it is free-form text, and no one knows quite what it means, and how to use it.
    - Step 1: grep the "stability" field for every module in Hackage.  [Here is a preliminary list](https://github.com/bgamari/hackage-mirror/blob/master/extension-analysis.ipynb#Stability-field)
    - Seek patterns/consensus.
    - Step 2: discuss (in this group) what a good proposal for an enumeration of values for th stability field.
    - Step 3: make a proposal to CLC

    - Question: is "stability" the main point here?  Our goal is to distinguish three kinds of module:
      - **Non-exposed**; no one can import this module
      - **Exposed and external**: this API is intended to be stable; specifically, it is subject to the PVP (major bump)
      - **Exposed and internal**: this API can be imported by client, but should be regarded as part of the package's implementation; not subject to the PVP (i.e. only minor bump)

      A module could be exposed-and-external, but nevertheless under development (not very stable), and the author might perhaps want to signal that via the stablity field.

    - Instead of proposing a hackage-wide change, let's start with a specific case:
      - Categorise each module in `base`.  Here is [Ben's draft](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WmyYLbJIMk9Q-vK4No5qvKIIdIZwhhFFlw6iVWd1xNQ/edit#gid=1315971213).   (Necessarily a compromise; since we expose everything right now, making *any* module "exposed-but-internal" is potentially a breaking change.)
      - Invite the CLC and others to suggest how we might encode this classification in a machine-readable manner (e.g. use stablity field, split into two packages, invent a new field)
      - Draft text here https://edit.smart-cactus.org/EjfMUGhOSzCnGpEsGLR4iA?edit#
      - Include columns for "Eventual goal" and "Proposed first step"
      - Need to think about deprecations cycles: we'd like to be able to mark a module in such a way that you get a warning if you import it (unless perhaps you suppress the warning at the import site); and the warning should suggest what *other* module you should import instead.

- [ ] Ben: Carry `base` stability proposal to CLC

## New items to discuss

- [Stablizing Template Haskell](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/issues/16)
  - Constructing syntax trees:
    - Encourage using quotations instead
    - When not possible, perhap use smart constructors
    - But when, specifically, is it not possible to use quotations?
  - Pattern matching on syntax trees:
    - What proportion of TH clients actually *analyse* (patttern-match on) TH syntax and why?
    - We think perhaps many analyse *data type decls*; and few analyse *expressions*.
    - Maybe an API to TH data decls would do the job.
    - Pattern synonyms could play a role, but they don't have to constitue the whole API.
    - John Ericson has a [GHC proposal to allow TH quotes in patterns](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/529)
  - We believe there is a relatively stable api to cover ~95% of use cases
    - e.g https://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-abstraction; last commit only a month ago.
    - basic idea: *do not attempt* to stabilise the TH syntax data type itself.
    - goal: have a stable API that satisfies 90% of clients.
  - Representative TH users:
    - `vector-th-unbox`
    - `aeson`
    - `lens`
    - `optics`
    - `QuickCheck`
    - `mustache`
    - `tasty-discover`?
  - Task (Trevis):
    - Examine representive TH users for how much effort is it to use th-abstraction
  - Task (Ben):
    - Engage with Eric Mertens and ask whether he agrees with our goal (we want to discourage direct use of the TH syntax data type; prefer quotes and abstractions); perhaps he wants to join a meeting
