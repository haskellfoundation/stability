# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss


- [GHC 9.10.1](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-10-1-is-now-available/9523) and [breakage guide](https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/tilapia/blob/master/breakage-inventory-ghc-9.10.md)
    - What about the GHC API.  Invite Alexis?
    - Ben: will add notes in the user manual to explain how plugins can avoid relying on hard-coding name locations.
    - Ben is optimistic about low breakage with GHC 9.10.1

- What do we think about [#24453](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24453)?  (Merge `ghc-prim`, `ghc-bignum`, `ghc-internal`)
    - Currently we get no gain, but we do get pain.
    - In future, it would be great to split out stuff, such as the IO library, thereby making them re-installable.   Yes yes!  But that's quite different to what we have now!
    - Conclusion:
        - thumbs up to general direction of #24453
        - explicitly flag up the goal of splitting out more re-installable packages, e.g. I/O.

- Lots happening on the TH front -- invite Sebastian and Teo next time?
    - #24783: **tracking ticket**
    - #24021: Making TH more stable
    - #24713: hygiene
    - !12479: moving stuff into `ghc-internal` to make `template-haskell` (more) reinstallable.
    - #24766 exposing stuff from L.H.TH.Lib.Internal
    - etc
    - [Twitter discussion](https://x.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1790047622675267727)
    - **Conclusion** Invite Teo and Sebastian to the next meeting.

- Making Prelude reinstallable? (Discussed last time.)  Design work needed.

  - Investigate [head.hackage](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/head.hackage) to answer this question: **for each patch in head.hackage, which of (1)-(5) in the [state-of-play doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sX_rXHx8Mj3Kae9GalR2BwZ5-xzl7UpnpMBwl4dqsWY/edit?usp=sharing) caused the need for the patch?**
      - Are there others not listed?
      - Holding the token: Ben
      - Patches: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/head.hackage/-/tree/master/patches?ref_type=heads

- Making base reinstallable?
