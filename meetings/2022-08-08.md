## Notes
- Haddocks for key infrastructure
    - Some packages are missing haddocks entirely, others partially
    - How can we help package maintainers lives easier to be consistent here?
    - Does this tie in with the package standards/badges?
        - Suggestion for standards: If a module is exposed, then it needs docs
        - Adds weight to guidelines work
        - Idea: Get help for "central" packages to help meet expectations
    - Racket is a good community to glean ideas from
    - Extensible documentation tooling would be helpful
    - Bring this up to academics
        - Holding the token: David
    - Recruit for helping community

- [GHC.X.Hackage](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27)
    - Still WIP

- [GHC tick-tock releases](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/34)
  - Previously table this until August

- [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view)
    - Have to keep scope in control
    - Send ideas that need more research to David
        - Holding the token: Trevis

- GHC warning policy document as discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
    - No progress

- Find industry user groups to help smoke test with ghc preleases from [May](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
  - Previously tabled this as we expect the cost to decrease.
