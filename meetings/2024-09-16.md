## New Items to discuss

- NixPkgs
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24518#note_582961
    - Is it the case that GHC HQ are not going to update 9.8 at all?  Instead encouraging people to jump to 9.10, and skip 9.8 altogether.
    - https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20240521-ghc-release-priorities.html says 9.8 will be supported
    - Would that be OK?  [GHC blog post](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20240521-ghc-release-priorities.html) said 9.8 would continue to be supported; but Simon's talk at HS'2024 said not.  Let's ask, and cause a post to appear to clarify.  **Action Jose**
- Tom Ellis's blog posts:
    - http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/ghc-8.10-9.6-experience-report/
    - https://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/behaviour-changes-flag-day/
    - Invite Simon Marlow to do the same -- Meta has done a similar upgrade cycle recently.
- Still want to better find what are the issues, how can we find them?
- Ben's summary of why it's hard to to get reinstallable `base`: https://edit.smart-cactus.org/h2z2ELauQs2vzhPDeUDr_g#
