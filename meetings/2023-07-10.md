# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Combining stability with innovation](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/51)
  * https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/475
  * Suggested principles:
      * Modules in `ghc-internals`, `base` and `ghc-experimental`, should not have the same name.
          * Eg no `Data.Tuple` in `ghc-experimental` since it is already in `base`
          * This is somewhat debatable because it means that moving stuff from `ghc-experimental` to `base` would be a breaking change for clients.
          * But having two `Data.Tuple` is pretty bad!  Require package-qualified imports, and thus a breaking change anyway.
          * And note that we could leave the module behind in `ghc-experimental` (with deprecation warnings) for some time, so the changeover could be gradual.  e.g. we could retain `GHC.Tuple` in `ghc-experimental` after it is moved to `base`; give very long deprecation cycle
      * Suggestion: by default modules in `ghc-experimental` start with `GHC.`
      * Suggestion: module in `ghc-internals` or in `ghc-prim` start with `GHC.Internal.`.  This is an advantage: it is very explicit signal (in the module not just in the cabal file) that you are importing something from GHC's internals.
      * Question: what about modules in the GHC API itself.  Do those modules start `GHC.`?  Or `GHC.API.`?
        * Ben: I don't view the fact `ghc` currently provides packages in `GHC.*` is problematic; renaming now would only cause pain. We should, however, address this when we eventually get to the GHC API design discussion


- [`@since` annotations](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23622)
    * Ben pointed to #23622.  General problem with `@since` annotations: if package `wombat` re-exports `foldr`, it `@since` annotation will refer to the version of `base` that introduced it, not the version of `wombat` that introduced it. Boo.
    * Somewhat related to the new export-item deprecation warnings [GHC proposal 134](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/134) and [595](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/595).  Can we add `@since` annotations alongside deprecation warnings?

- [Extension lifecycle framework proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/601)

- [Weeder update bringing new configuration format](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/weeder-2-6-released-supporting-ghc-9-6/6909)
  - How can we encourage the community to embrace transition periods for things like this?
  - Due to https://github.com/ocharles/weeder/pull/120
  - The original motivation is given in https://github.com/ocharles/weeder/pull/117:
    > As much as I like Dhall, it's a pretty heavy dependency for this project. It adds around 100 transitive dependencies, and that can make upgrading to newer GHCs tedious.
  - Issue: https://github.com/ocharles/weeder/issues/130

## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- [ ] Add to `mtl` migration guide a way to work with prior and new versions
  - Previously holding the token: Chris

- [ ] Template Haskell
  - Adam started looking into [#20828](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20828) (adding field names to TH AST) at Zurihac
  - David mentions that adding `hlint` checks enforcing use of
    selectors instead of positional matching would be useful
