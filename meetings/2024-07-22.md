# Agenda & Notes

## Items to discuss

- Broaden membership
    - Post on Haskell Discourse saying (**Trevis**)
        - where minutes are
        - what we have been discussing
        - when we meet
        - how to join the meeting (meetings are open)
        - possible "hook" for the post: classification of Hackage failures (once **Jappie** has posted)


- Language extension stability classification next steps
  - Now that https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0601-extension-lifecycle-framework.md is accepted...
  - A GHC Proposal with a large set of extensions classified according to the accepted proposal
  - Start from: https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/discussions/635
  - With a note that, in order to make progress, if there is any controversy about how to classify a particular extension, the extension will not be classified in the proposal and considered again later.  The proposal will list these explicitly.
  - **Jose** will summarise the #635 discussion (perhaps summary of the proposal is more appropriate).   Could conceivably lead proposed polishing to (accepted)
  - **Trevis** will write the proposal

- Cabal/GHC [big picture](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-and-cabal-the-big-picture/9968)
    - Could this be one concrete thing for a joint ecosystem team (GHC/cabal/HLS/stack/plugin authors) to work on?
    - Questions: can plugins alter any of this behaviour?
    - Want newbies to be represented.  E.g. How to make a "batteries included" version of GHC, by asking Cabal to install a bunch of libraries.
    - **Jose** will try to get more eyes on this.

- (Jappie)
     Go through [head.hackage](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/head.hackage/-/tree/master/patches?ref_type=heads
 ) categorise according to the [5 categories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sX_rXHx8Mj3Kae9GalR2BwZ5-xzl7UpnpMBwl4dqsWY/edit)
   - Ask questions about head.hackage: ghc-devs@haskell.org
   - Then **Jappie** will make a post advertising the results (and limitations...)
   - Invite collaboration to take it further
   - Ideally: when adding/removing patches from head.hackage, update the counts. Clear mechanism for offering such an update.  Maybe make the classification/counts part of head.hackage repo.


## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- None

## In progress projects
### Updates

- JMCT: What would a GitHub mirror that posts to GHC GitLab look like?

- [Simon's list of GHC-related stability issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sX_rXHx8Mj3Kae9GalR2BwZ5-xzl7UpnpMBwl4dqsWY/edit?usp=sharing)
