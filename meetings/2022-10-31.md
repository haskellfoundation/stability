## Notes of meeting

- cabal.project with warnings for multiple ghc versions.
    - Would be nice if we had an expression language, though we don't expect to get that
    - How often does a new warning being added to Wall break the ability to use older compilers?
    - Any conclusion /actions here???

- [`GHC2023`](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/quo-vadis-ghc2023/5220)
    - Tom: [original proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0372-ghc-extensions.rst) said annual GHC20xx releases; but Tom would prefer every 5 yrs or so.
    - Trevis: The community isn't moving quick enough to give good feedback every year.
    - SPJ: GHC team would be happy with any consensus here, and would be thrilled if the Stablity group evolved such a consensus.
    - Question: does this group want to lead a consensus-building activity?
    - Answer: yes, and Tom is willing to lead.
    - Starting with an email to ghc-steering committee.
      - Holding the token: Tom

- [Creating and maintaining a set of hlint rules to promote stability](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/pull/14)
    - Hlint does not seem to have the ability to write rules around class methods that have defaults
        - So writing a rule for (/=) is not possible currently.
    - Take to the community
    - C.f. New [GHC style guide](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/coding-style)
    - Mention the things we would like to do, but HLint can't manage (yet)
    - Holding the token: Trevis

- Bulletin discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-10-17.md)

    - Holding the token: David
    - No update
- [GHC.X.Hackage second draft](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27)
    - David and Ben have discussed this. Do not want to follow the Technical Working Group proposal (right now)
    - Instead run a pilot project, say for the GHC 9.6 branch.
    - Make crystal clear to potential contributors how to contribute to such a head.hackage branch, based on [this draft blog post](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/homepage/-/merge_requests/29)
    - Move content into head.hackage repo so that it becomes editable as things change. (Blog is an advert; and points to the repo doc)
