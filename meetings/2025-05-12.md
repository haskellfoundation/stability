# Attendees

- Ben Gamari
- Jose Calderon
- Teo Camarasu

# Agenda & Notes

## New items

- Teo has written up a GHC proposal to split out some stable libraries from `template-haskell`: https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/696
  - DerivingLift is a sticking point. https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/696#issuecomment-2836062613
    - This dependency appears to be on the GHC implementation - perhaps a build tool constraint in cabal
    - Ties into extension stability
    - Is definitely a broader conversation, can happen with more than TH and DerivingLift.
      - Idea: Split a 'discussion' on github

- Monad of no return https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/328
  - Brought up at previous meeting, much more discussion being had here, anything we should add?
  - Even with long deprecation/warning schedules it is hard to still get changes through
    - See also StarIsType
    - Idea: Make things become werror by default prior to removing?

- In two meetings, we are scheduled on the last day of zurihac, do we want to change anything?
  - Meet mostly face to face!

- Data.Text.show changes in a minor release of GHC: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/issues/7743
  - Want to know about this kind of thing ahead of time
  - Run something like head.hackage against stackage
    - Is a much bigger packageset, which helps catch more issues like this


## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- hie file format stability question:
  We have been experiencing pain on every ghc upgrade with hie files. We use stan and weeder which both demand the version of hie files match exactly the ghc version. Is there anyone working on making those files use a stable format?
  - JMCT to bring up with Andreas Klebinger
  - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18329
  - Update: Andreas seems to think that this is not currently a priority
      - Should it be?
      -

- Do the changes to GHC that require a `cabal` update also effect `stack` in the same way?
    - JMCT to bring up with Mike P.
    - Update:

- See what the HF can do about the gap in cabal release management.
    - JMCT to investigate.

- Minor edits, discussion on [extension classification proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/669).
