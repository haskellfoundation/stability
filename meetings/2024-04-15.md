# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- Are there stability related projects to promote at Zurihac?
  - hackage improvements
  - recommendations for packages/gold star
  - error message index
    - Are there metrics on page views for errors with no explanation?
    - Any metrics at all?
    - Cabal integration?
  - security db integration
  - In person session prioritizing stability pain points.
    - Idea: Give 5 pain points with detail, ask for rank and other issues not included.
    - GHC upgrade pain points
- [GHC 9.6 issues to prevent recommendation by ghcup](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/rfc-ghcup-should-ghc-9-6-4-be-recommended/9325/11)
  - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24518
  - Linker issues in thread, but no tickets
  - Suspect this might be in part because of hurdles to report issues
    - Could it be possible to report issues without gitlab account
    - Idea: github mirror with bot that will post issues to gitlab - allowing for more "drive by issues".
  - Who is responsible for doing these kinds of tests?
    - GHC team _could_ do this
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-hq/-/tree/main
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/platforms
    - Community members, have not reported these in the 4 point releases so far.
    - To be brought up with GHC team

## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- JMCT: What would a GitHub mirror that posts to GHC Gitlab look like?
    - Is it possible? If not, why not?
    - (Doesn't have to be a 'mirror' per se, but could be a separate project that guides users to the correct places)

## In progress projects

  - [Extension lifecycle framework proposal #601](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/601)
