# Agenda & Notes

## Items to discuss


- (jappie)
     go through [head.hackage](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/head.hackage/-/tree/master/patches?ref_type=heads
 ) categorise according to the [5 categories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sX_rXHx8Mj3Kae9GalR2BwZ5-xzl7UpnpMBwl4dqsWY/edit)
        + as of today
           https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xNAn7qE1X7waI7lAIh9lOUKGuEb9HnRwGWNicaywASk/edit?usp=sharing
           + (spj) it'd be nice to know the reason why these broke
           + (spj) it'd be nice to know which of the TH breakages would be solved by the TH roadmap (eg 1,2,3 or 4)
           + (spj) it'd be best to add a column if it can be compiled with 9.8 (since we then started caring) (this maybe difficult to do however)
           + (trevis) add a column with when the patch was added (or date of last modification)
           + how large is the head.hackage package set (how stable are we?), this is to provide contextual information, with these patches applied you can compile all of this.
        + as of one year ago
        + as of two years ago
        + for now we'll add the causes first, then add more snapshots from later ago. Adding the date column would also help.
        + we want to have this in a more digestable form so we can announce it. Eg provide context such as tell how many packages there are in head.hackage

- [ghc 9.6.6](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-6-6-is-now-available/9852)
  - Ask ghc-dev list about timelines given 9.12, 9.10 and 9.8 have no information

- [cabal 3.12.1.0](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/cabal-install-3-12-1-0-and-accompanying-libraries-released/9830/4)
  - Ask for a revision to release notes for clarity
