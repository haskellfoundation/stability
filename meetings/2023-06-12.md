# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Exceptions backtrace CLC proposal](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/164)
  - The end state seems agreed upon
  - Perhaps clarify what is new versus what is changed
  - Split base will help us here
- [Split -Wunused-imports](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/586)
  - Do we really want the relaxed redundant imports?
  - Conclusion: Do the simple thing

- [Is there a way to reduce Template Haskell breakages](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/stability-working-group-may-2023-update/6398/2)
  - This was asked on the post for updates from us.
  - We need more material to discuss, i.e. what are our options here?


## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- [ ] Add to `mtl` migration guide a way to work with prior and new versions
  - Previously holding the token: Chris

- [ ] Examine TH users for possibility of `th-abstraction`
  - Previously holding the token: Trevis
  - Crystal Mika from Flipstone reports:
    - It appears that `optics`, `aeson`, `quickcheck` and `mustache` either already use `th-abstraction`, or do not have a straightforward path to using it.
