# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Naming proposal](https://github.com/simonpj/hf-tech-proposals/blob/ghc-module-naming-2023/proposals/0000-ghc-module-naming.rst)
    - David asked if `import A.B.C` could import the `A.B.C` modules from *all* packages that are made available in the Cabal file.   Answer: not currently.  Would at very least require a GHC proposal.
    - Does the proposal address a question worth answering.  Answer: yes, please.
    - Trevis: GHC API redesign.  Good idea to have `GhcAPI.*` to distinguish from `GHC.*`.
    - Proposal 1/2/3: succcessive refinements, not alternatives!
    - Starting with `Experimental.Wombat.Thing` in `ghc-experimental`, and migrating to `Wombat.Thing` when it moves to `base`, forces clients to update their imports.  In some ways using the *same* module name in `ghc-experimental` as in `base` could make this switchover easier.  (But there would be have to be an extended period in which `Wombat.Thing` is available in *both* `ghc-experimental` and `base`.  And that might leave a period in which `import Wombat.Thing` is ambiguous.  But maybe if it simply moves, without a deprecation period, that'd be OK -- provided `base` and `ghc-experimental` come as a pair.... but that might conflict with reinstallable `base` goals.)
    - Worked example of introduction of features and their life cycle.
        - Tuple3
        - HasField
        - HasDict

    - Not everything in `ghc-experimental` will end up in `base`!
    - Timescale: first release with this stuff in will be 9.10, in around 6 months time.
    - Limited goals!
    - Expectations around `ghc-experimental`.
        - Major bump at every GHC release
        - Migration cost when moves to `base`.
        - Deprecation cycle is a reasonable expectation.  Might prove impossible.

- [Extension lifecycle framework proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/601)
  - Specifically, do we need to do anything else here?
  - Nothing for us to do at this time
  
- [Crypton fork](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/pull/931#issue-1743179602)
    - Hackage trustees have historically been very reluctant to give control over part of the namespace to someone new, if the author can be contacted and doesn't want to - is this the right policy?
        - This has frequently not ended well in other communities
        - A vulnerability that goes unadressed for a long time in a security package that doesn't get updated is a big risk
        - We will now have a place to advertise security issues - the need for a takeover is reduced by this
- [readFloat issue](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23538) 

## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- [ ] Add to `mtl` migration guide a way to work with prior and new versions
  - Previously holding the token: Chris

- [ ] Template Haskell
  - Adam started looking into [#20828](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20828) (adding field names to TH AST) at Zurihac
  - David mentions that adding `hlint` checks enforcing use of
    selectors instead of positional matching would be useful
