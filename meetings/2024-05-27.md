Previous meeting [notes](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2024-05-13.md)

# Attendees

- Jose Calderon
- Teofil Camarasu

# Agenda & Notes

## Items to discuss

- GHC [release priorities](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20240521-ghc-release-priorities.html)
  This is a privately shared concern from someonone in the community:
    - GHC 9.8.2 suffers from the same plugin/cabal interaction issue that 9.6.4 did. This blocked
      the upgrade path to the 9.6 series and now 9.8 is blocked as well. Calling 9.6 more high
      uptake feels like a self-fulling prophecy when there are known blockers to upgrade.

  Difficulty is one of maintaining many releases all at once.

  Stackage support for 9.10?

## Template Haskell

From previous meeting: Lots happening on the TH front
- https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24783 : **tracking ticket** (out of scope for today)
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24713 : hygiene (perhaps out of scope as well)

 - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24021 : Making TH more stable (main focus for today); points to [The Plan](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/template-haskell/Plan-to-Stabilise-Template-Haskell)
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12479 : moving stuff into `ghc-internal` to make `template-haskell` (more) reinstallable.
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24766 exposing stuff from L.H.TH.Lib.Internal
    - etc
    - [Twitter discussion](https://x.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1790047622675267727)
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20828 : Stable API ideas for template-haskell AST. [sneak peek](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20828#note_503817)

Context: lots of "wired-in" identifiers.
- [!12479](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12479 ) will help a lot.
- Then the TH library can be a separate (reinstallable) library, just like any other library.
- New GHC release(X+1) can come with a TH library (say 2.8.2) that has the *exact same API* as for GHC(X), which came with TH 2.8.1
- This should fairly completely suport class `(A)` and class `(B)` clients.
- But class `(C)` and `(D)` clients need more:
    - New data constructors, or changes in existing constructors, in TH Syntax.  Class ``(D)`` clients are affected, but they are few in number so maybe we can accept that.
    - Class ``(C)`` clients (who do reification) need a stable API.  We should redesign it -- it was a design error to use source-language data types for the results of reification.   See https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24021#reification
- Solving (A) (B) and \(C) clients would get us a **long** way.   Focus attention on them first!  Then we can give attention to (D) later.
    - We need a `template-haskell` libarary with a stable API for A/B clients; and a `template-haskell-unstable` with an unstable API for C/D clients.   Or just use `ghc-internal` instead of `template-haskell-unstable` (free design choice here).  An advantage of this is that clients must explicitly opt-in to instability in order to get access to more features.
- For class C clients, what is the incentive to move to the new, stable API?  Answers:
    - it is more stable!  So it won't break across GHC versions.
    - it is a better API.

- Perhaps explicitly lay out the proposed stable API (as a GHC proposal or a CLC proposal) and invite public comment.
- Survey of users: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IpJuk9x6wIoY57VhRlu218bPv8qiqFUXqPfr-zOB16E/edit#gid=0

- Path forward:
  - Define stable API proposal for class B clients
      - Mostly a carefully chosen subset of current `template-haskell` library -- primarily omitting the constructors of data types themselves
      - One possible design choice to make the transition easier: API could offer (possibly-deprecated) uni-directional pattern synonyms (for construction only) for the existing data constructors.  `Var` and `varE` would therefore be very similar.
  - Get feedback
  - Release new stable API (in a new package? Move unstable api to new package?)
  - Define new reification api proposal for class C clients
  - Get feedback
  - Release new reification api
  - Get adoption by class B and C clients
  - (Leave class D as out of scope for now.)

General message: the Haskell Foundation, and the Stability Group in particular, is strongly in support.  Teo and Sebastian: thank you, and please do ask for help/support when needed.

Idea: flesh out The Plan in more detail, and then blog about it, to generate enthusiasm and help.
