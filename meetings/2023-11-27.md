# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Template Haskell issue](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24021)
  - Perhaps related to this [reinstallable base](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/h2z2ELauQs2vzhPDeUDr_g#) doc.
  - Reinstallable base
    - Ongoing work
  - Goal: extend reinstallable-base to template-haskell
    - Needs reinstallable base first
  - Actions: Ben and Simon to polish reinstallable base proposal.
  - Will become HF Tech Track proposal

- [c2hs breakage](https://github.com/haskell/c2hs/issues/291)
  - Possibilities:
      - Move away from c2hs (towards hsc2hs)
      - Port c2hs to another parser (e.g. clang)
      - Continue with the status quo, patching things as necessary
      - Hybrids of the above
- [ghc-experimental](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/200)
  - ghc-experimental doesn't seem like a huge benefit for this one specific case, as pointed out in thread.
