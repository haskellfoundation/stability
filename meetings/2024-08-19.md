# Agenda & Notes

## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

  - Minor edits and encourage discussion on [extension classificaiton proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/669).
    - Post to discourse, and bring up at ghc weekly

## New Items to discuss


- Hécate: I recently published a couple of tools to make it easier for maintainers to care about API stability of their package. [You'll see the announcement here](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/maintain-a-golden-test-of-your-packages-api-with-diff-package-api-and-print-api/9997). My idea would be that SWG could promote / recommend tools that can be added to a maintainer's toolbelt with a guarantee of increased software quality as a result.
  - Are we hesitant for HF to be "choosing" tools?
    - Present it at possible tools
    - Let's do it!
    - Action item: Trevis to draft how this might look.

- I am working on bootstraping a Release Engineering team with an ethos focused on serving the end-users and collaborating closely with the tooling teams (which may not share the same ethos due to differing constraints and priorities). Can the SWG help in setting the moral principles that will guide this team?
  - Prior art to take inspiration from: https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/freebsd-releng/
  - Some guiding ideas:
    - Release schedules (not deadlines)
    - Clear communication
    - Defined/documented release practices
    - Defined/documented responsible parties
    - Defined/documented dependencies (e.g. cabal depends on ghc which depends on cabal)
    - Defined/documented support timeframes

- Hécate: I am creating a blog on haskell.org for the teams of the Haskell Project, including the SWG. Should you make big announcements or publish reports, it will be a place that will get a lot of visibility and feedback. More than happy to discuss the details during the call.
  - Jappie/Trevis to write intro to SWG
