# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Draft](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/4j4gkZuUQj2fWwG9z8mQrQ) of update to [Extension lifecycle framework proposal #601](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/601)
    - Main payload: proposes 5 categories: Stable, Experimental, Preview, Deprecated, Legacy.
    - These would be the categories into which #635 will divide language extensions.
    - Is there a useful distinction between Experimental and Preview?  Preview is just "even more experimental" than Experimental.  E.g. LinearTypes are much more experimental than TypeFamilies.
    - SPJ instinct: start with Stable/Experimental/Deprecated/Legacy; that will result in less bike-shedding.  An uncontroversial step in the right direction.
    - **Action**: Trevis will publish as an update to #601.

- [Fortifying language editions #636](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/636).  Payload:
    - Easy win: language edition can affect
        - warnings
        - error messages
    - More doubtful: language edition can affect the meaning of (say) `-XGADTs`
        - definite costs as well as benefit
    - More doubtful: nanny-state disallow some extensions in some editions, retiring language editions.
    - Semantics bundles (synonyms for a collection of extensions and warnings): put in separate proposal.
    - Default language edition
        - Arguably max stability from: default = Haskell2010

    - **Action**: all: express views on #636.
