Previous meeting [notes](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2025-08-18.md)

# Attendees

- Trevis Elser
- SPJ
- Jappie
- Teo Camarasu

# In progress projects
## Updates

- [hie library split](https://gitlab.haskell.org/jappeace/ghc/-/merge_requests/1)
  - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18329
  - Jappie is making progress, lots of work involved

- Jappie: catagorizing head.hackage https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xNAn7qE1X7waI7lAIh9lOUKGuEb9HnRwGWNicaywASk/edit?gid=251085624#gid=251085624
  - [x] Figure out which language extension semantics caused these changes.
  - [ ] Draft a haskell.org blog about findings and advanced warnings

- Cabal exact-print proposal _seems_ to be passing the TWG, so work can start on that soon.
  - TWG is currently in voting period, which ends August 22

# New items

- We need to update the HF website to mention us!
  - "mention us" means point to GitHub.
      - Put Minutes before Contacting us
      - Under members advertise that anyone can join
  - Under projects?  (Ask Jose.)
  - Should there be a section for working groups? (Ask Jose)

- [Second round of language extension categorizations](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/9-rAGONfQGGthwrLBmY8_w#)
  - Why is PackageImports deprecated
    - Jappie: How would you two packages having the same module names without package imports
      - Teo: This might be fixable using a Cabal feature ([mixins?](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-package.html#pkg-field-mixins))
  - Things are are surprising to me that they are "experimentatl":
      - DuplicateRecordFields
      - Strict
          - This feels like the extensions is pretty understood
          - Maybe issue is communication regarding what the extension actually accomplishes
      - Arrows, if it's not stable, why not?
      - Functional Dependencies, is it likley to move?

- From last time: The implementation of DataKinds seems to not be beavhing as an extension should. Code that should be rejected (or at least, once was rejected) by DataKinds is now not being rejected, see [the GHC ticket](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26318#note_632229)
    - Jappie: You would think that there would be test in GHC's test-suite that would catch these sorts of things
        - Issue and issues like it have been around for years (see Ryan's comment on ticket).
        - What would it take to strengthen the DataKinds regression tests?  Nothing came to mind.
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26318#note_632229
    - **Conclusion**: commits have already landed that make small, but obscurely breaking, changes in GHC.  Unfortunate, but we don't want to undo this.

- Teo's blog post about updating to GHC-9.10: https://informal.codes/posts/upgrading-to-ghc-9-10/
  - Great to have positive signal for updates
  - Biggest annoyance: changes to export lists.  This would be dramatically ameliorated when we are no longer forced to update `base`.
  - 7 yrs ago [Trevis wrote this](https://engineering.itpro.tv/2018/09/28/haskell-in-production-a-ghc-upgrade-success-story/) -- another success story

- Reinstallable `base`
    - We are "very close" (Teo) with GHC 9.14.
        - Final step: make a release of `base` on Hackage
        - See: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26134
    - Main idea: **`base` is like any other package**.
        - There are still **some** reasons why we can't use an old `base` with a new GHC; not many.
            - List them: plugins, aspects of Template Haskell,...
        - Really need a blog post!  Maybe Well Typed could write?
        - Perhaps something similar on Template Haskell, with clear advice on how to make your TH code more robust and forward compatible.
    - Cabal update already makes it much eaiser.
        - [One more Cabal issue to go](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1044) -- its built-in preference for the "libraries that come with GHC"; but this just "nice to have".  It lets you use a version of `base` released *after* (say) 9.14.
    - Can we use the 9.12 `base` with 9.14?  Not sure.
    - NB: sometimes people use `base` version as a proxy for GHC version.  Need to advise them what to do instead.
      - You can test the GHC version directly: `impl (ghc >= 9.2)` inside of cabal conditionals
    - How does the presence of the `GHC.*`` modules in base impact this?
    - How do we _expect_ this to interact with stackage?
      - Would we expect stackage to release an "lts" for 9.14 using the 9.12 base, if more packages compile that way?
