# New items

- https://discourse.haskell.org/t/using-record-patterns-synonyms-to-evolve-a-data-type/13106
  - PatternSynonyms could clearly be a feature to help with stable api transitions, if things like this would/could be resolved.
  - Perhaps open a Haskell Foundation TWG proposal to get funding?

- Report from upgrading GHC (9.6 -> 9.10):
  - Some bugs in GHC itself, but the far bigger issue is upgrading the rest of the tooling/libraries:
