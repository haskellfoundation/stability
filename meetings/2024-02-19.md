# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [Fortified language editions](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/636)
  - This is big
  - Can we reduce scope somehow?
    - Take GHC20XX + warnings + stability statement?
  - Bundles might be _more_ confusing for exactly the users that it seems to target.
    - Proposal would seem to be much lighter if we said the bundles were seperate.
