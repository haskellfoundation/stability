# Attendees

- Trevis Elser

# Agenda & Notes

## In progress projects
### Updates

- [extension classification proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/669)
  - under review of steering committee

- [hie library split](https://gitlab.haskell.org/jappeace/ghc/-/merge_requests/1)
  - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18329

- [Simon's list of GHC-related stability issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sX_rXHx8Mj3Kae9GalR2BwZ5-xzl7UpnpMBwl4dqsWY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Work on reinstallable base is picking up steam (Earliest ETA is 9.16)
  - Reinstallable template-haskell also being worked on (Needs investigation but _might_ work for 9.14)

- Jappie: catagorizing head.hackage https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xNAn7qE1X7waI7lAIh9lOUKGuEb9HnRwGWNicaywASk/edit?gid=251085624#gid=251085624
    - Figure out which language extension semantics caused these changes.

## New items

- [GHC LTS announced](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20250702-ghc-release-schedules.html)
  - How can we effectively promote and explain the LTS here along with the Stackage LTS for the community?
	- First question that came up in discussions: Will there be a Stackage LTS release for _every_ point release on a GHC  LTS branch
	 - Example: Suppose that 9.20 is the "current" GHC, when a new point release for 9.14 comes out, 9.14.X. Should we expect a new Stackage LTS for 9.14.X?
   - Invite Jens to a meeting to talk about this.
