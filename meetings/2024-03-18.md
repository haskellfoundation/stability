# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- [ghc-pkg, Cabal, stack, and plugins](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24518)
  - Could we separate out the bits of cabal ghc needs to a separate package?
    - In theory it could happen
  - Need a cabal release.
    - Don't know what is involved there.
    - Cabal release is "slowly moving forward".
  - Conclusion: fix this issue and hope we don't hit it again.
  - Idea: Get more cross team involvement: Various parties invited to the Thursday Cabal sync

- [Gracefully handling package abandonment](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/issues/7336)
  - A member of the community reached out for us to discuss this.
  - Botan bindings as an example:
    - Community groups with multiple maintainers
    -
