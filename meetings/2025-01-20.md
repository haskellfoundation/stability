# Agenda & Notes

- Renovate support for cabal (a dependency bounds bumper)
    - Github source code: https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate
    - Producty (less technical) landing page at https://www.mend.io/renovate/
    - Cabal feature documented at: https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/haskell-cabal/
    - The problem we are trying to solve:
        - You are author of library L, which depends on `bytestring`
        - `bytestring` has a new release
        - `renovatebot` polls Hackage, and proactively offers you a PR for *your* libary `L.cabal` file that updates you to the new `bytestring`.
        - Moreover, this is a SaaS service you can sign up for; no need to install anything.
        - SaaS signup flow at https://github.com/apps/renovate
          * Documentation is available but people don't have to have read it to use the SaaS
    - What does this get us as a community?
        - "Another place where we are meeting industry".  Dependency updates Industrial best practice already uses `renovate` ( or something similar like `dependabot`).
        - A path to automate some library authors' work.  Less friction, easier to get library updates done (at least for library authors that buy into `renovate`).
        - Timely (i.e. earlier) signalling to library authors that new versions of your dependencies are available, so you might want to get on with updating your package.
    - Related to the [Hackage e-mail notification for dependencies](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/hackage-dep-bound-notifications-and-uploader-endorsements-for-new-users/8342?u=janus)

- [GHC 9.12.1 correctness issue](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/psa-correctness-issue-in-ghc-9-12/11204/1)
  - Is this a testing/CI gap?
  - Cabal change caused a test suite to not to be run
      - there was a bug in cabal
        the test suite in primops worked around the bug with a patch
        the bug was fixed in cabal
        this disabled the primops test suite
        which caused a while to be detected.
        which caused a bug to be slipped in within the GHC runtime
      - the change: https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/9061
  - 9.12.2 should be out in a few weeks
  - Are there other workarounds like this lurking?
    - How easy is it to find similar workarounds?
    - Can the workarounds be more robust?
      - No way to block a portion of a cabal file with a version of cabal.
      - This is currently unknown
      - Can we collect these like the breakage inventories?

- Status of [GHC release policy doc](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-hq/-/merge_requests/38)
  - Review and revision in progress
