# Agenda & Notes

## Action Items From Previous

- [x] Chris will post a summary of our conversation about base reform to [tech-proposals thread](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/47)
- [x] Trevis will seek additional commercial user feedback on [GHC medium-term priorities](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-medium-term-priorities/5600)
- [ ] David will talk to Julian about ghcup and nightlies.

## New items to discuss

  - [Discussion](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/language-library-and-compiler-stability-moved-from-ghc-9-6-migration-guide) around stability from 9.6 migration
    - Is there a systemic view that can help with the frustration here?
    - Chris: Additional communication/better communication would reduce stress
    - Proposal: Request GHC Steering Committee for a small number of no migration required releases
    - Trevis: I suspect nightlies will unlock lots of potential value here
  - [In-progress work at classifying `base` stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/EjfMUGhOSzCnGpEsGLR4iA?edit)
    - Trevis proposes: Formalize the stability field in haddock module documentation
    - This will be a big breaking change for many people (if only answering the question of does a dependency need to be added/changed)
    - Does this make the deprecation of exports work more important?
