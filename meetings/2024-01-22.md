# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss

- From community (private communication): noticed that release notes for GHC 9.6.4 reference issues
  that appear to still be open? What does this mean? Are they fixed?
     - Examples: [23952](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23952) and
       [23185](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23185)
     - Generally, issues being open still even after a release, is expected. Issues are kept open
       (a) for backports or (b) if there is more work to be done.
     - 23952 is in fact not fixed in 9.6.4, error in release notes.


 - Seeking information about stability, to inform prioritisation:
     - What delays or prevents you updating to a new version of GHC?
     - Be specific, concrete, precise.
     - Offer a menu of causes for delay:
         - `base` API changed
         - Template Haskell API changed
         - Dependent libraries have not been updated
         - Behaviour of the compiler itself, with the same flags, changes.
         - Dependent tooling have not been updates (hls, cabal, stack, hlint, etc).
         - We maintain a fork of GHC
         - Other (say what)

      - For each, offer a free-text box to be more specific.
      - Things under discussion that might help. What priority would you give them?  Recognising
        finite resources etc.
          - Reinstallable `base` (see [these
            notes](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/h2z2ELauQs2vzhPDeUDr_g#))
          - Stable TH API: [#24021](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24021),
            [#20828](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20828)
          - [GHC.X.Hackage](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27): Hopefully
            will reduce time to libraries supporting new GHC releases
          - Some kind of [3-release
            policy](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/issues/629)
          - Other (please say what)
