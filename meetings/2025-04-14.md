==============

Meeting URL: https://meet.jit.si/StableHaskellMeetBiWeekly

Previous meeting [notes](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2025-03-31.md)

# Attendees

- Trevis Elser
- Ben Gamari
- Teo Camarasu
- Jose Calderon
- Simon Peyton Jones

# Agenda & Notes

## New items

- TemplateHaskell
    - Teo wrote up some notes about next steps here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gui1YXOvrNihR3NpXuMVCKV3lTkKPL8y_HDRjbZyRxk/edit?tab=t.0
    - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/13569
      - Library authors could depend on these new libraries instead of template-haskell directly, so a more stable interface, less version bound bumping!
      - Is there a reason to have these as separate libraries? They expose some of the same types, so could they be merged?
        - Ensuring compatibility gets harder
      - Present this as a proposal to community for more feedback
        - Engage CLC to give a heads up
        - Teo to create a ghc-proposal for the 3+ library solution

- ghc-9.6.7 and new flags
  - New flags being added to a point release, but how to _consistently_ say when they are available?
    - If user's guide says "Since 9.6.7" should readers expect flags to be available in _some_ release of 9.8, 9.10, or 9.12?


## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- hie file format stability question:
  We have been experiencing pain on every ghc upgrade with hie files. We use stan and weeder which both demand the version of hie files match exactly the ghc version. Is there anyone working on making those files use a stable format?
  - JMCT to bring up with Andreas Klebinger
  - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18329

- Do the changes to GHC that require a `cabal` update also effect `stack` in the same way?
    - JMCT to bring up with Mike P.

- See what the HF can do about the gap in cabal release management.
    - JMCT to investigate.

- Minor edits, discussion on [extension classification proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/669).
