# Agenda & Notes

- [GHC API stability](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-api-stability-update-1/11033)
  - Can/should we help coordinate or assist?
  - JMCT will get the SWG plugged into what's going on with the GHC API
      - No need for the SWG to interfere in anway, it's about keeping up to date with what they're doing and offering support.

- GHC 9.12.1 and Cabal 3.14 released
  - Any lesson to be learned from Cabal needing a point release so quickly?
      - they forgot to bump: https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/10656/files
  - JMCT will speak with Hecate about the release and see if there are ways to prevent same issue in the future.
