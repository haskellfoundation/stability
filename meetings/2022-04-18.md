## Notes

- [GHC.X.Hackage](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/27) update
    - Progressing with a prototype based on [foliage](https://github.com/andreabedini/foliage)
    - Holding the token: Ben

- Update on GHC tick-tock releases
    - Holding the token: Ben

- [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view)
    - Strech goal: Rehabiliting Orphans
    - Holding the token: Trevis

- [Update on API breakage policy](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/breakage-and-deprecation-cycle-policies/4281)
    - Parked due to lack of interest

- [cabal-install breakage](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/8076#issuecomment-1087806908)
    - Could announce a version saying the discussed warning will be an error
    - Perhaps we need more frequent releases of 'cabal-install'?
    - Not any action for us to take as a group

- [Keeping a list of community ideas](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/issues/11)
  - Suggestion: Make a list easy to see in our repo
  - Trevis to create this list in the repo

- [Checking multiple CPP combinations](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/issues/11)
    - SWG to host discussion for this but not any other action for us to take at this time.

- [Private Dependencies](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4035) and suggested [here](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/issues/11)
    - This is tricky
    - Idea: Can we step towards this with not exposed instances?
    - Benefit for this could be large

- [Rehabilitating-Orphans-with-Order-theory](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/Rehabilitating-Orphans-with-Order-theory) also suggested on [here](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/issues/11)
    - Bring up on github that it would help to make the wiki page more concrete
    - Goal: Reform Wiki page into something that could be implemented
    - We could help review as a way to get towards a HF Tech Track proposal
