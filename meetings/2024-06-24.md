Previous meeting [notes](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2024-05-27.md)

# Attendees

- Jose Calderon
- Jappie

# Agenda & Notes

## Items to discuss

- Papercuts from newcomer to [hackage](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/publishing-my-first-package-in-hackage)
  - Primarily, the synchronization between hackage, cabal and ghcup is rough
  - `cabal check` improvement suggested in thread
    - We can look into/suggest this if not done already by those on the thread.
  - What else can we do to help smooth over these cross project bumps?

- Tools for centralized discussion
  - Perhaps GHC is not included, or at least somehow secondary. GHC is already central due to its nature in the ecosystem. Potential minimum set:
      - cabal
      - hackage
      - ghcup
      - stack
      - hls
      - haddock

- Any updates on Template Haskell?
