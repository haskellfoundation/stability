# Agenda & Notes

## New items to discuss


## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- [ ] David: Conversations about GHC nightlies

- [ ] Ben: Add definition of tech preview on website and/or wiki mentioned during [March 20th meeting](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2023-03-20.md)
  - David: Is this better for wiki or user's guide? Suggests user's guide.
  - Trevis asks: Does the user's guide need a glossary?
  - Resolution: Do the quick thing - add a glossary page to user's guide

- [ ] Chris: Add to `mtl` migration guide a way to work with prior and new versions
  - Keeping track of decision history and rationale would be useful, not just for `mtl` but in general.
  - Desired properties: shows how to write code that works with multiple versions (not just the new one), contains the rationale for why this change was made and is worth it

- [ ] Trevis: Examine TH users for possibility of `th-abstraction`
  - In progress, but not ready to report yet

- [ ] Trevis: Ask Aeson for backport of TH issue disussed [last time](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2023-04-03.md)

## In progress projects
### Updates

  - Bulletin discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-10-17.md)
    - Previously holding the token: Chris

  - GHC warning policy document as discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-30.md)
    - Previously holding the token: Chris
    - This has come up in the [community](https://github.com/haskell/mtl/pull/128/files#diff-3f5ccdc580f9a52f9193a34761434a4142f8ff453bf38a47b0df627abb0a53c7)
    - From previous meeting notes:
      - Maybe we should articulate, in GHC's breakage policy, that new warnings may be added that warn about code that currently doesn't warn; and hence -Werror will force authors to make some change to their .cabal file.
      - Wcompat: new warnings are by default added to -Wcompat. You can switch on -Werror and -Wno-error-compat (or something like that). We should explain that.
      - GHC migration guide could list new warnings.
      - Tom will add the link to the Core Libraries warning policy
      - Chris will draft a proposal -- essentially, part of a new GHC breakage policy doc.

  - [Creating and maintaining a set of hlint rules to promote stability](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/pull/14)
    - Previously holding the token: Trevis
    - Opened [issue](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/issues/1440) asking if we can write rules for typeclasses.

 - GHC API discussed [previously](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability/blob/main/meetings/2022-10-17.md)
    - Previously holding the token: David

  - [Update on Language/compiler features to help stability](https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw?view), specifically [#4879](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/4879)
    - Previously holding the token: David + Simon
    - Now being done by IOG internship!
