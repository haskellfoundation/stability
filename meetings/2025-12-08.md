  - Help in speeding up profiling would be good
  - there is a WIP unified reference for profiling
      - there are tons of references to it, eg blogpost on how to do profiling
      - there is a placeholder here: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/Overview-of-GHC's-profiling-tools



- Jappie: catagorizing head.hackage
  - https://blog.haskell.org/investigating-language-extension-semantics/

- Trevis: Extension categorization
  - Preparing next proposal

- Jappie: Cabal exact-print proposal
  - Opened a PR for comment parsing! https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/11252
  - Still making progress!

- Ben/Andreas/GHC team: Reinstallable `base`
  - Working on blog post to describe project motivation and progress
  - Test suite being moved/decoupled
  - Shout about it more!  Release GHC 10.0 instead of 9.16
  - Lots of discussion on [CLC ticket 375](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/375) and [Haskell Discourse ticket](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/what-are-the-next-steps-for-reinstallable-base/13319)

- Jose: Page listing community volunteers doing important work

# New items

- Meta item, upcoming meetings and end of year holidays:
  - Have meetings scheduled for Decemember 22nd and January 5th, should we skip either or both of these?
    - Skipping the 22nd and holding the 5th

- No hackage release for ghc-9.12.x of [ghc-boot-th](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-boot-th)
  - Trevis: Open a ghc issue about this
  - Teo: This exists: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26240

- in exact print common stanza merging, we're struggling with getting
pattern synonyms to behave for backwards compatibility, any advice would
be welcome.
https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/11277#issuecomment-3575709221
     -> current implementation is a footgun because setting mulitple
records breaks subtlety.
     -> we grepped for record use in all of hackage and found around 60,
         -> this still misses direct constructor use (is there a better
way of doing this?)
         -> maybe we just want to take the 60 compile errors and not
introduce the pattern synonym?

  - Perhaps related: https://discourse.haskell.org/t/using-record-patterns-synonyms-to-evolve-a-data-type/13106
  - overlaoded record dot may also work?

  - hackage can be a directionality indicator, but it's not sufficient for  deciding all breakage. best would be if we could build with pre-release cabal on commercial code base? how to do this? don't know. cf deep subsumption

  - CLC stackage stuff to build all of ~~hackage. ~~
    - a subset of stackage is what is built

- https://github.com/stable-haskell
  - Appears to be putting in good work, find more ways for this group to collaborate
  - Known timezone challenges, but would like more direct contact
