    - Backporting 9.14


# New items

- [Hpc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpc), [Haddock](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock), [Haddock-api](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock-api) and possibly others have not seen releases for newer ghc and/or base.
  - Are there other "in tree" tools/libraries that live with ghc that are in this situation?
  - How can we help make sure that upon a new ghc release (say 9.14) that these are released to hackage as well?

  - All three are part of the main `ghc` repo, so they are built by CI.  Shall we ask for a volunteer to be the release manager for `hpc`, `haddock`, `haddock-api`, simply to make the Hackage releases.
  - We could usefully have a list of community volunteers who do useful stuff.
      - **Jose** will make this page
      - Small tasks with individuals.
          - Maintainers for key libraries
      - **Someone to remind everyone else of their tasks, following a GHC release**.  We have a list... just need someone to pursue it.  Ecosystem Release Manager perhaps?
      - Larger projects with groups: GHC, stack, cabal, HLS
  - Release tracking ticket 9.14.1 https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26122
