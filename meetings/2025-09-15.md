  - [Exact-print mega-issue](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7544)
  - [Jappie's proposal that HF should fund cabal exact-print](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/pre-proposal-cabal-exact-print/9582)
  - [The proposal itself is here](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/65)
  - [HF Technical Working Group](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/blob/main/proposals/PROPOSALS.md) is currently in voting period, which ends August 22
  - Jappie is meeting with JMCT this week.  Is TWG active?  Does it have a chair?  Why is David C still listed?

- Reinstallable `base`
  - `base` split out into a separate repo (a sub-module for GHC); not yet landed in HEAD
      - CI working
      - Testsuite now passing
      - Still todo: a blog post to explain what has now happened and how you will now dance for joy.

  - Separately, working on cleaning up interfaces that might pose stability risk
      - First example of such a clean-up: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26265
      - [base API description spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WmyYLbJIMk9Q-vK4No5qvKIIdIZwhhFFlw6iVWd1xNQ/edit?usp=sharing).
          - ToDo: update spreadsheet
          - ToDo: CLC proposals for removing GHC.ArrayArray etc
          - Blog post to advertise the task, seeking volunteers, on blog.haskell.org (Ben)
              - good firstime issues!
      - Clearly in discussion with CLC


# New items

- GHC 9.10.3 released
  - What does it mean for issues to still be open on the [milestone](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/milestones/409#tab-issues) but there is a release?
    - Just need issues to be remilestoned

- Given GHC 9.14 recently has a new alpha [announced](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-14-1-alpha2-is-now-available/12955) and is supposed to be the first of the new LTS releases, how can we promote testing it ahead of time?
  - Get a document on how to test with an alpha, what issues to look out for, and where to report issues
  - ghcup "vanilla" channel makes it eaiser to install at least
  - this issue would help (for future releases) https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/issues/1050
