# Agenda & Notes

## New items

- ghc-9.6.7 and new flags
  - New flags being added to a point release, but how to _consistently_ say when they are available?
    - If user's guide says "Since 9.6.7" should readers expect flags to be available in _some_ release of 9.8, 9.10, or 9.12?
    - The specific flags here are a very tricky situation
    - Flags added to a (A.B).C release should be added to all new releases for (D.E) branches where (D.E) > (A.B)
    - To do: MR against https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-hq/-/blob/main/release-management.mkd?ref_type=heads setting out this invariant
    - See also: https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/principles.rst#33stability-gr1

- Teo has written up a GHC proposal to spllit out some stable libraries from `template-haskell`: https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/696
  - Add thoughts and comments
  - Bring up at the next meeting

- Discussed HIE AST split
  - Split out AST into separate package, keeping design unchanged.
  - Ben suspects that a proposal isn't strictly needed here

- Monad of no return https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/328
  - Suggestion: maybe make the warnings cause an error for a couple of releases before doing this change.
  - These methods (return/mappend) should probably be seperate proposals so they're easier to accept.
  - it's discussed earlier: (meth on meth) https://edit.smart-cactus.org/jeFTSfj9SRun6ywmj1Tqcw#
  - Tricky cases w.r.t. introducing suppressable error for non-canonical definitions: https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/687#discussion_r2029812269


## Short-Term Action Items From Previous

- hie file format stability question:
  We have been experiencing pain on every ghc upgrade with hie files. We use stan and weeder which both demand the version of hie files match exactly the ghc version. Is there anyone working on making those files use a stable format?
  - JMCT to bring up with Andreas Klebinger
  - https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18329

- Do the changes to GHC that require a `cabal` update also effect `stack` in the same way?
    - JMCT to bring up with Mike P.

- See what the HF can do about the gap in cabal release management.
    - JMCT to investigate.

- Minor edits, discussion on [extension classification proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/669).
